## Who Is Evelyn Dibell?
Hi! My name is Evelyn Dibell and I'm from ALexandria, VA (NOVA) which is about 20(ish) minutes outisde Washington D.C. I'm planning on graduating from The College with a degree in International Relations. This is my first time taking a data science class so I'm not that experienced, but I really wanted to try something new!

Some other fun facts about myself are that I love to travel, learn about different cultures, and dance. I'm also an only child (yes it's very lonely) and have a very cute dog named Bali (pictured below). 



These are my exercises: 
1. [excersise1](Practice1.md)
